Introduction: We analyzed Berkeley's admissions data with the goal of exploring whether there is gender bias

Implementation:We did the whole process in R. We used a quarto for appearance, which makes our output report more beautiful, and we plotted a lot of graphs to prove our conclusions.

Results or Conclusion: We conclude that no significant bias exists from a gender perspective.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9035318-68f8-4f10-a4d0-31969d16aff4)
